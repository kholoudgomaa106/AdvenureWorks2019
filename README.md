# AdvenureWorks2019
The project centered around the AdventureWorks dataset, a comprehensive and complex data set that provided me with an excellent opportunity to hone my data analytics and visualization skills.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective:
The primary goal was to analyze the AdventureWorks data after installing it from Microsoft's official resource. The challenge was not just in understanding the data but also in presenting it in a way that could drive meaningful business decisions.

ðŸ’¼ Data Preparation:
My approach included meticulous data cleaning and organizing. I created several Views in Power BI for some of which were created using the incredible tool Power Query.

ðŸ“Š Dashboard Creation:
The culmination of my work was an interactive three-page dashboard that provides insights into various business aspects. The dashboard highlights:

Overall Company Performance: A general overview of business areas, salespersons, order frequency, and product performance.

Operation Report: This section focuses on sales team performance, offering insights for potential rewards, performance comparison, and trend analysis against previous months and quarters.

Inventory Report: Detailed insights into our product inventory, helping in strategic decision-making.

This project was not just about data analysis; it was about transforming data into a storytelling tool that can guide business strategies. I learned a great deal about the nuances of Power BI, data visualization, and how to make data speak in a business context.
